      description: >-
        This service provides full access to arbitrary database queries.
        Queries are accepted in a serialised XML or JSON format, executed and returned
        in a streaming manner. The query format is a custom subset of the capabilities
        of SQL; see the InterMine documentation for a full description of the query XML and JSON
        syntax.

        This endpoint specialises in dealing with queries for sequence
        annotations, and returning results in [GFF3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_feature_format)
        format. The user is responsible for
        ensuring that the query contains only suitable types for export.
        A suitable query is one where every view column references a
        field of a `SequenceFeature` (including all sub-classes). The
        particular field selected is not important, and the object itself
        will be selected.
